	abstract = {A recently published theory has suggested that a cloak of invisibility is in principle possible, at least over a narrow frequency band. We describe here the first practical realization of such a cloak; in our demonstration, a copper cylinder was {\textquotedblleft}hidden{\textquotedblright} inside a cloak constructed according to the previous theoretical prescription. The cloak was constructed with the use of artificially structured metamaterials, designed for operation over a band of microwave frequencies. The cloak decreased scattering from the hidden object while at the same time reducing its shadow, so that the cloak and object combined began to resemble empty space.},

The material consists of a two-dimensional array of repeated unit cells of copper strips and split ring resonators on interlocking strips of standard circuit board material. By measuring the scattering angle of the transmitted beam through a prism fabricated from this material, we determine the effective n, appropriate to Snell{\textquoteright}s law. These experiments directly confirm the predictions of Maxwell{\textquoteright}s equations that n is given by the negative square root ofɛ{\textperiodcentered}μ for the frequencies where both the permittivity (ɛ) and the permeability (μ) are negative. Configurations of geometrical optical designs are now possible that could not be realized by positive index materials.},

abstract = "Galvanised by the emergent fields of metamaterials and topological wave physics, there is currently much interest in controlling wave propagation along structured arrays, and interfacial waves between geometrically different crystal arrangements. We model array and interface waves for structured thin elastic plates, so-called platonic crystals, that share many analogies with their electromagnetic and acoustic counterparts, photonic and phononic crystals, and much of what we present carries across to those systems. These crystals support several forms of edge or array-guided modes, that decay perpendicular to their direction of propagation. To rapidly, and accurately, characterise these modes and their decay we develop a spectral Galerkin method, using a Fourier–Hermite basis, to provide highly accurate dispersion diagrams and mode-shapes, that are confirmed with full scattering simulations. We illustrate this approach using Rayleigh Bloch modes, and generalise high frequency homogenisation, along a line array, to extract the envelope wavelength along the array. Rayleigh–Bloch modes along graded arrays of rings of point masses are investigated and novel forms of the rainbow trapping effect and wave hybridisation are demonstrated. Finally, the method is used to investigate the dispersion curves and mode-shapes of interfacial waves created by geometrical differences in adjoining media."
