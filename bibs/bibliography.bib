We describe here the first practical realization of such a cloak; in our demonstration, a copper cylinder was {\textquotedblleft}hidden{\textquotedblright} inside a cloak constructed according to the previous theoretical prescription. The cloak was constructed with the use of artificially structured metamaterials, designed for operation over a band of microwave frequencies. The cloak decreased scattering from the hidden object while at the same time reducing its shadow, so that the cloak and object combined began to resemble empty space.},

The material consists of a two-dimensional array of repeated unit cells of copper strips and split ring resonators on interlocking strips of standard circuit board material. By measuring the scattering angle of the transmitted beam through a prism fabricated from this material, we determine the effective n, appropriate to Snell{\textquoteright}s law. These experiments directly confirm the predictions of Maxwell{\textquoteright}s equations that n is given by the negative square root ofɛ{\textperiodcentered}μ for the frequencies where both the permittivity (ɛ) and the permeability (μ) are negative. Configurations of geometrical optical designs are now possible that could not be realized by positive index materials.},

abstract = "Galvanised by the emergent fields of metamaterials and topological wave physics, there is currently much interest in controlling wave propagation along structured arrays, and interfacial waves between geometrically different crystal arrangements. We model array and interface waves for structured thin elastic plates, so-called platonic crystals, that share many analogies with their electromagnetic and acoustic counterparts, photonic and phononic crystals, and much of what we present carries across to those systems. These crystals support several forms of edge or array-guided modes, that decay perpendicular to their direction of propagation. To rapidly, and accurately, characterise these modes and their decay we develop a spectral Galerkin method, using a Fourier–Hermite basis, to provide highly accurate dispersion diagrams and mode-shapes, that are confirmed with full scattering simulations. We illustrate this approach using Rayleigh Bloch modes, and generalise high frequency homogenisation, along a line array, to extract the envelope wavelength along the array. Rayleigh–Bloch modes along graded arrays of rings of point masses are investigated and novel forms of the rainbow trapping effect and wave hybridisation are demonstrated. Finally, the method is used to investigate the dispersion curves and mode-shapes of interfacial waves created by geometrical differences in adjoining media."

abstract = "Metamaterials are artificially structured materials with the promise to remove performance constraints associated with conventional materials, redefining the boundaries of materials science and offering a wealth of new opportunities for innovation and economic growth.
 The prospects are powerful. National security applications of metamaterials range from enhanced stealth technology to improved military communication to higher-quality reconnaissance imaging to next-generation body armor. Health implications range from greatly improved medical imaging and research tools to superior injury protection products. Metamaterials also have promising energy applications in transportation light-weighting, as well as energy generation and storage technologies. By 2025, it is estimated that metamaterials manufacturing will be a multi-billion-dollar market.
 The United States has invested heavily in the potential of metamaterials, and U.S. experts and research facilities lead the world in publications, citations, and intellectual property related to this emerging field. Realizing the true benefits of these emerging technologies—and return on federal investments—will require advancing metamaterials from prototypes to products manufactured at scale. Manufacturing of these materials at the volume and quality needed for practical applications requires process innovation and establishment of a strong supporting ecosystem. This report examines the challenges and opportunities facing metamaterials manufacturing and presents a set of actionable recommendations for realizing the promised impact."

abstract = "This study addresses the flexural behavior of the metamaterial beam containing membrane-mass structures that can be used as local resonators. The finite elements method is employed to predict dispersion relations and the bandgap structure of the proposed metamaterial beam. By altering mass location, membrane tension, and mass magnitude, the characteristics of the bandgap can be easily tuned. Multiple resonant-type bandgaps can be achieved by varying the mass distribution across cells of the metamaterial beam. To precisely capture the resonance frequency of the membrane-mass structure, an analytical model is introduced. The effect of membrane dimensions on bandgap characteristics is also examined."

        abstract = {We investigate elastic periodic structures characterized by topologically nontrivial bandgaps supporting backscattering suppressed edge waves. These edge waves are topologically protected and are obtained by breaking inversion symmetry within the unit cell. Examples for discrete one and two-dimensional lattices elucidate the concept and illustrate parallels with the quantum valley Hall effect. The concept is implemented on an elastic plate featuring an array of resonators arranged according to a hexagonal topology. The resulting continuous structures have non-trivial bandgaps supporting edge waves at the interface between two media with different topological invariants. The topological properties of the considered configurations are predicted by unit cell and finite strip dispersion analyses. Numerical simulations demonstrate edge wave propagation for excitation at frequencies belonging to the bulk bandgaps. The considered plate configurations define a framework for the implementation of topological concepts on continuous elastic structures of potential engineering relevance.}

        abstract = {The electronic structure of the two-dimensional material MoS2 has two distinct {\textquotedblleft}valleys{\textquotedblright} of energy that may help to carry information in future electronic devices. Mak et al. observed the so-called valley Hall effect in a monolayer of MoS2. The electrons from different valleys moved in opposite directions across the sample, with one valley being overrepresented with respect to the other. The scientists achieved this by shining circularly polarized light on the material, which created an imbalance in the population of the two valleys. The findings may enable practical applications in the newly formed field of valleytronics.Science, this issue p. 1489Electrons in two-dimensional crystals with a honeycomb lattice structure possess a valley degree of freedom (DOF) in addition to charge and spin. These systems are predicted to exhibit an anomalous Hall effect whose sign depends on the valley index. Here, we report the observation of this so-called valley Hall effect (VHE). Monolayer MoS2 transistors are illuminated with circularly polarized light, which preferentially excites electrons into a specific valley, causing a finite anomalous Hall voltage whose sign is controlled by the helicity of the light. No anomalous Hall effect is observed in bilayer devices, which have crystal inversion symmetry. Our observation of the VHE opens up new possibilities for using the valley DOF as an information carrier in next-generation electronics and optoelectronics.},

We show that it acts as a photonic topological insulator (PTI), and that an interface between two such PTIs can support edge states that are free from scattering. The conservation of the valley degree of freedom enables efficient in- and out-coupling of light between the free space and the photonic structure. The topological protection of the edge waves can be utilized for designing arrays of resonant time-delay photonic cavities that do not suffer from reflections and cross-talk.}
