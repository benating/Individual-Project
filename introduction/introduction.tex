\section{Objectives}
In this project, our main goal is to be able to geometrically navigate waves
around sharp and gentle bends by constructing a semi-infinite lattice composed
of two structurally different materials where the waves will travel along the
boundary between the two materials. In our case, we will consider elastic waves
travelling through a mass-spring system.

In particular, we will be carrying out the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Build an intuition to study dispersion relations by first finding them
      for simpler models.
\item Perturb structures of elementary cells of infinite lattices to open up
      band gaps.
\item Construct a semi-infinite lattice formed of ribbons created from two
      differently perturbed elementary cells and observe wave behaviour at the
      boundary.
\item Simulate scattering to confirm direction of dissipation of energy.
\end{enumerate}
