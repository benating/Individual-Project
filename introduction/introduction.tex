\chapter{Introduction}
The study of metamaterials has the potential to solve many modern engineering
problems.

\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item Perturb structures of semi-infinite lattices to open up band gaps
\item Simulate scattering to confirm direction of dissipation of energy
\end{itemize}

\section{Practical applications}
It is also important to discuss the real-life applications which this project
can lead to.

\begin{itemize}
\item Developing a cloak of invisibility \cite{emcloak}
\item Constructing antennae to focus energy into narrow beams \cite{diremi}
\item Producing devices which operate on the terahertz ($1THz=10^{12}Hz$) range
      \cite{THz}
\item Developing near perfect electromagnetic absorbers \cite{absorbing}
\end{itemize}
