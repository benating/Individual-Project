\chapter{Introduction}
Since the dawn of mankind, we have sought to better understand the natural
world around us and so create technologies to improve our lives. At first by
utilising what nature already has to offer, but later on developing materials
and devices which have desirable properties not found in nature.

Metamaterials are precisely that; materials engineered to possess some property
not found in naturally occurring materials \cite{briefintro}. Usually these
materials are composed of smaller units which are arranged in a repeating
pattern. They derive their properties not from the intrinsic properties of the
base materials, but from the periodic structure introduced.

\section{Practical applications}
It is important to discuss the real-life applications which this project can
lead to as the study of metamaterials has the potential to solve many modern
engineering problems.

\begin{itemize}
\item Developing a cloak of invisibility \cite{emcloak}.
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Obvious use cases in military.
      \item Protect things from electromagnetic radiation.
      \end{itemize}
\item Constructing antennae to focus energy into narrow beams.
      \cite{diremi,antennasol}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Gather wave energy from deep in the oceans and concentrate them to
            be harvested.
      \item Channel sound energy, e.g. from train tracks, to be dissipated
            elsewhere which decreases noise pollution.
      \end{itemize}
\item Producing devices which operate on the terahertz ($1THz=10^{12}Hz$) range.
      \cite{THz}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Can be used in medical imaging due to terahertz radiation being
            able to penetrate thin materials but not thicker objects. Also, it
            is non-ionising radiation and so does not damage living cells
            unlike X-rays.
      \item For surveillance, especially security screening as many materials
            of interest have unique spectral fingerprints in the THz range
            \cite{Thzsec}.
      \end{itemize}
\item Developing near perfect electromagnetic absorbers \cite{absorbing}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item Perturb structures of semi-infinite lattices to open up band gaps
\item Simulate scattering to confirm direction of dissipation of energy
\end{itemize}
