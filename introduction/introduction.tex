\chapter{Introduction}
The study of metamaterials has the potential to solve many modern engineering
problems.

\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item Perturb structures of semi-infinite lattices to open up band gaps
\item Simulate scattering to confirm direction of dissipation of energy
\end{itemize}

\section{Practical applications}
It is also important to discuss the real-life applications which this project
can lead to.

\begin{itemize}
\item Developing a cloak of invisibility \cite{emcloak}
\item
\end{itemize}
