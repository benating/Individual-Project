\chapter{Evaluation}
% TODO: Compare results to those of more complex models; look at other papers
% and use their parameters

\section{Further work}
% TODO: Can split into what we can do in terms of different perturbations/
% grading etc; but also look at computing side, e.g. split into classes so
% easier to run simulations and get dispersion curves etc
% - evaluate the robustness of our systems (real life production isn't
% perfect), how resistant it is to small imperfections
% - compare the two different kind of perturbations. Is there a difference?
% Alternating mass one seems to be better. Amplitude is higher
% - how short can the strip be that we still get the effect
