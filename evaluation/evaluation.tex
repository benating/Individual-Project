\chapter{Evaluation}
% TODO: Compare results to those of more complex models; look at other papers
% and use their parameters

\section{Further work}
% TODO: Can split into what we can do in terms of different perturbations/
% grading etc; but also look at computing side, e.g. split into classes so
% easier to run simulations and get dispersion curves etc
% - evaluate the robustness of our systems (real life production isn't
% perfect), how resistant it is to small imperfections
