\chapter{Conclusion}
Herein we have constructed various different model mass-spring lattices on
which we have built up not just the mathematics, but also the codes, to allow
us to analyse the effects of a topological perturbation. This has led us to
discovering various different configurations of lattices which permit a wide
range of wave propagation manipulation. As we see that our results match those
obtained from other models, we anticipate that our model system is a good
approximation and can be used to model more complex waves.
