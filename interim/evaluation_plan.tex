\chapter{Evaluation plan}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Compare dispersion relations and scattering results of our models to
        those published before. If no exact comparisons exist, tune our
        parameters to match those of other papers to confirm our codes do the
        right thing.
  \item Look at results of scattering and see if they correspond to the
        bandgaps which we see in our dispersion relation.
  \item Are we able to navigate the waves around both gentle and sharp bends?
\end{itemize}
