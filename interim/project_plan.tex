\chapter{Project plan}

\section{What has been done}

\subsection{Report}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Thought about the structure as a whole, and arranged
        chapters/subchapters into an order which (I think) flows naturally and
        smoothly.
  \item Most of the Introduction and Background. I do not expect there to be
        major changes to these parts anymore. However, I think that I can still
        expand more on the points already mentioned.
  \item Started discussion of basic models to form the basis of intuition for
        the more complex model which our project revolves around. Done with 1d
        lattice and about 2/3 through the 2d square lattice.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Codes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Set up codes to produce dispersion curve for 1d lattice and 2d
        hexagonal lattice.
  \item Also created code to produce dispersion curve for 2d perturbed
        hexagonal lattice and hexagonal ribbon, but requires more testing to
        validate. 
\end{itemize}

\section{What to do}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Finish off section on Brillouin zones; then finish off 2d square
        lattice. Also, fix 2d square model image so it shows the separate
        cells with labels.
  \item Complete section on 2d hexagonal lattice. Should be relatively
        straightforward since we can build on what has already been explained.
  \item Fix any bugs in codes; generate dispersion curve for perturbed lattice
        and locate bandgap. Then, carry out scattering to confirm results.
  \item Complete corresponding sections of report.
  \item Prepare final project presentation.
\end{enumerate}

\section{What else to do (if time permits)}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Consider other arrangements (e.g. kagome vs hexagon, different shape of
        bends in our semi-infinite lattice)
  \item Consider active metamaterials? (e.g. metamaterials which change their
        shape/elasticity over time?)
\end{enumerate}
