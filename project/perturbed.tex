\chapter{Perturbed system}
\label{perturbed}

So far, we have seen how to compute the dispersion relation for some simple
lattices. Now we want to see what sorts of effects we can create by introducing
some perturbations. We will do this in terms of changing the masses as well as
the spring constants between each mass in Chapter \ref{formbandgap}. Later on
in Chapter \ref{formstrip}, we will form a 2d strip or ribbon of these cells,
with the top half possessing one set of properties and the bottom half
possessing a different set of properties. We will see that this cause an
interesting phenomenon to occur at the boundary of the two halves.

\textit{Note}: As the hexagonal model contains more symmetries due to the shape
of its elementary cell, we will be focusing on perturbing these models, but the
same can be done for the square lattice as well.
