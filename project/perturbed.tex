\chapter{Perturbed system}
\label{perturbed}

So far, we have seen how to compute the dispersion relation for some simple
lattices. Now we want to see what sorts of effects we can create by introducing
some perturbations. We will do this in terms of changing the masses as well as
the spring constants between each mass in Chapter \ref{formbandgap}. Later on
in Chapter \ref{formstrip}, we will form a 2d strip or ribbon of these cells,
with the top half possessing one set of properties and the bottom half
possessing a different set of properties. We will see that this cause an
interesting phenomenon to occur at the boundary of the two halves.

\textit{Note}: As the hexagonal and kagome lattices contain more symmetries due
to the shape of their elementary cell, we will be focusing on perturbing these
models, but the same can be done for the square lattice as well. 

\section{Band gap}
\label{formbandgap}

  relation of hex lattice when $k=2$ and $\tilde{k}=1$.}
\end{figure}

A band gap, also called an energy gap, is an energy range where no wave states
can exist. In terms of our lattices, this corresponds to a range of frequencies
where waves are unable to propagate through the material; and in graphs of
dispersion relations, it is seen as gaps in the frequency axis where no line
is present. An example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bandgapex}.

\section{2d bulk hexagonal perturbation}
One way to perturb our bulk hexagonal lattice is by breaking one of its
rotational symmetries. Currently our hexagonal lattice has six-fold rotational
symmetry, i.e. rotating our cells by $\frac{2\pi}{6}$ do not change them. We can
reduce this to a three-fold symmetry by alternating the masses such that
$M_1=M_3=M_5 \neq M_2=M_4=M_6$.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{imgs/hexperturbM.png}
\caption{\label{fig:hexM} The effect of alternating the masses $M_i$ on the
  dispersion relation of the bulk hexagonal system, with all other parameters
  set to $1$.}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:hexM}, we see that alternating masses has opened up the
double dirac point at $\Gamma$ and formed a bandgap.
%TODO: What is a dirac point?

\section{2d bulk kagome perturbation}
Similarly to the hexagonal case, we can perturb the different parameters in our
bulk kagome system to see what effects they have on the dispersion relation.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{imgs/kagomeperturbM.png}
\caption{\label{fig:kagomeM} The effect of perturbing the mass $M$ on the
  dispersion relation of the bulk kagome system, with all other parameters set
  to $1$.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{imgs/kagomeperturbk.png}
\caption{\label{fig:kagomek} The effect of perturbing the inner stiffness $k$
  on the dispersion relation of the bulk kagome system, with all other
  parameters set to $1$.}
\end{figure}

We can see the effects that perturbing the mass $M$ and inner stiffness $k$
have on the bulk kagome system. In the case of varying $M$ in
Figure~\ref{fig:kagomeM}, increasing $M$ decreases or constrains the dispersion
relation, while decreasing $M$ increases or widens the dispersion relation. 

However, in the case of varying $k$ in Figure~\ref{fig:kagomek}, we see the inverse
effect; increasing $k$ increases or widens the dispersion relation, while
decreasing $k$ decreases or constrains the dispersion relation. Another
interesting thing to notice about changing $k$ is that it causes the formation
of a bandgap!

With these two inverse relationships, we are naturally propelled to ask what
happens if we combine both of these effects together. For example, by
increasing $M$ and increasing $k$, would the two effects \textit{cancel out} to
give us the same dispersion relation as the unperturbed system?

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{imgs/kagomeperturb2.png}
\caption{\label{fig:kagome2} The effect of perturbing both the mass $M$ and the
  inner stiffness $k$ on the dispersion relation of the bulk kagome system,
  with all other parameters set to $1$.}

\section{2d hexagonal strip}
\label{formstrip}
%TODO: How does bandgap relate to the dispersion along the boundary?

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{imgs/hexstripmodel.png}
\caption{\label{fig:hexstripmodel} Schematic view of the 2d hexagonal
  semi-infinite lattice made from an infinite number of strips connected
  side-by-side. Each strip is composed of 2N cells, with the top half of cells
  above the boundary (green) possessing a set of properties and the bottom half
  possessing a separate set of properties.}
\end{figure}

Now we assemble $2N$ hexagonal cells together into a strip and form a
semi-infinite hexagonal lattice by joining these strips from side-to-side as
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hexstripmodel}. We will subscript the values
corresponding to the top half and bottom half with $t$ and $b$ respectively,
e.g. $k_t$ to refer to the inner spring constants for the top half and
$M_{1,b}$ to refer to the mass of mass $1$ in the bottom half. We set the outer
spring constant, $\tilde{k}_t=\tilde{k}_b=\tilde{k}$ to be the same throughout
the strip, to ensure that it agrees on both sides of the boundary or interface.

Using the same reasonings in Chapter \ref{2dhexdisper} to form equations
between adjacent cells, we can also form an eigen-problem as before (where the
size of our matrix is now $(2N \times 6) \times (2N \times 6)$ instead of $6
\times 6$). The only difference and extra care we have to take is to insert the
right coupling terms between masses in different cells, e.g. $M_3$ is not
connected to $M_6$ displaced by some phase shift anymore, but is connected to
$M_6$ in the cell below. Specifically we get, %TODO: Add equations for 2,5 and
3,6

Also we impose the periodic boundary condition at the top and bottom edges by
coupling the top and bottom cells together across the edge. This essentially
gives us an infinite lattice, which allows us to use all the theorems we have
been using before, and if we take $N$ to be large enough, the exponential decay
of the wavefunctions across the strip is great enough to ensure our solution
approximates the real semi-infinite lattice well enough. Specifically, we
impose
%TODO: Fix blabber on periodic boundary condition and add boundary equations

With those, we can finally form the eigen-problem

\begin{align}
  \left[\matr{A}\left(\kappa_{x},\kappa_{y}\right)-\matr{\Omega}\matr{M}\right]\vec{y}=\vec{0}
\label{eq:hexstripeig}
\end{align}

where $\matr{\Omega}=\diag\left(\left\{\Omega_i^2\right\}\right)$,
$\matr{M}_{t}=\diag\left(\left\{M_{i,t}\right\}\right)$,
$\matr{M}_{b}=\diag\left(\left\{M_{i,b}\right\}\right)$,

\end{array}\right]
\end{align}

Solving this with $M_{i,t}=M_{i,b}=k_t=k_b=\tilde{k}=1$ over the irreducible
Brilloun zone gives us the dispersion relation in
Figure~\ref{fig:hexstripdisper}.

  possessing a separate set of properties.}
\end{figure}

As we have just done in the hexagonal case, we assemble $2N$ kagome cells
together into a strip and form a semi-infinite lattice with these strips
connected left-to-right as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:kagomestripmodel}.

Using the same conventions as the hexagonal strip case, we form the eigen-problem 

\begin{align}
