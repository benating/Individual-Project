\chapter{Scattering simulation}
\label{scattering}
Finally after all our hard work of investigating the dispersion curves of
different lattices as well as finding out how to perturb them such that we form
a bandgap, we will actually simulate how a wave of a certain frequency
propagates and scatters through a finite portion of one of our lattices.

Similarly to how we joined cells together to from a strip, we will do the same
and join strips to form a finite lattice. We may then solve the eigen-problem
systems that we had in physical space to see how the energy or wave moves
throughout the entire space. All we need to do is pick a frequency for the wave
we want to simulate as well as where we want the source of excitation to be.

From the dispersion relations, we know which frequency waves are able to
propagate across the lattice and which frequencies are not transmitted through
the lattice.
