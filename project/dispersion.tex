\section{Wave propagation across an infinite 2d hexagonal lattice}
We will now consider how waves propagate across a 2d lattice made of hexagonal elementary cells. 

\subsection{Model formulation}
%TODO: Add image to show model
Consider an infinite 2d plane made of hexagonal unit cells of six masses $M_i$
for $i\in\left(1,6\right)$, which are arranged in an inner hexagon rotated
$frac{\pi}{6}$ relative to each cell. Now we take the spring constant to be $k$
between masses within the same cell and $\tilde{k}$ between masses in adjacent
cells.

\subsection{Brillouin zones}
The concept of Brillouin zones was first defined by Leon Brillouin in
\cite{brillouin}.
