\chapter{Background}
Waves exhibit many characteristics when travelling through different mediums. 

\section{Dispersion relation}
A dispersion relation relates the wavenumber of a wave to its frequency. We
will see that this relation is of utmost importance when discussing periodic
lattices as only waves of certain frequencies are transmitted by the lattice.
